Flask-Visujax is in developement. It does not yet provide a stable API,
is not tested and documented. You may want to wait some months before
using it.

Flask-Visujax provides a number of widgets to create dynamic scientific
visualization using Ajax.

Widgets are reusable so you can program in Python instead of HTML and
JavaScript.

Flask-Visujax is extensible via plugins.
